## User Flow & Features

Sound Art Smart guides the user through a short series of image-based selections in order to present a random assortment of up to 6 artworks matching their specified interests. The user can then learn more by viewing the artwork information pages which include the work's title, artist, date, medium and much more. Should the user want to come back later, they can save their favourite artworks. As an added bonus, users can view their favourites in a styled gallery page--a one-of-a-kind exhibit all their own!
